# INFO216: Group Project - Spring 2021
## <i>A Knowledge Graph for professional E-Sports</i>

This repository contains code and other resources for a group project in the course [INFO216](https://www.uib.no/emne/INFO216): Knowledge Graphs at the University of Bergen.
The project group consists of three UiB students: [Jonatan Berg Romundgard](https://github.com/Jonnashell), [Ole Einar Markeset](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ole-einar-m-6ab735120/) and [Sebastian Einar RÃ¸kholt](https://github.com/SebastianRokholt). <br>

The aim of this project was to create a Knowledge Graph for the Overwatch E-Sports League using semantic technologies such as Python RDFlib, Blazegraph and DBpedia Spotlight. First, we collected data from The Overwatch Lab and the Liquipedia API. We then built a knowledge graph with players, teams, matches, tournaments and more with Python RDFLib, which generated a graph in Turtle format. This result was then imported to Blazegraph in order to run complex SPARQL queries on the final graph. We were thus able to investigate complex relationships between players, teams, game data and much more.
